# AI-Driven-Smart-Grid-Energy-Data-Pipeline-and-Forecasting
In this project, we will build an end-to-end data engineering and analysis pipeline focused on electricity consumption data in the U.S., with the goal of forecasting short-term energy demand. This topic not only demonstrates data engineering skills but also showcases data science/ML skills through modeling
